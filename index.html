          The President leaves the office on Monday, 29 May 2023, 9:00am
        </h4>
        <p>
          President Buhari assumed office on the 29th May 2015 after suceeding
          Goodluck Jonathan.<br />
          He assumed office riding on the wave of fixing insecurity the country
          was plagued with and still plagued with.<br />
          He delivered a presidential speech that had the famous line <br />
          <span style="color: #1a1423"
            ><em
              >"I belong to everybody <br />
              And I belong to nobody"</em
            ></span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          This statement left people in awe of him but the curtain was about to
          unfold when he made this remark in an interview.<br />
          <span style="color: #1a1423"
            ><em>
              “I hope you have a copy of the election results. <br />
              The constituents, for example, gave me 97% [of the vote] <br />
              cannot in all honesty be treated on some issues <br />
              with constituencies that gave me 5%.”</em
            ></span
